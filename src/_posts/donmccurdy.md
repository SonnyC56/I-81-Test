We are excited to include [Don McCurdy](https://twitter.com/donrmccurdy) as a
core developer on the A-Frame open source project! Don is a developer at Google
working on [Project Sunroof](https://www.google.com/get/sunroof). Since A-Frame
was released in December 2015, Don has been active in the community.
Volunteering in some of his free time, Don has:

- Built popular A-Frame components such as [controls](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/tree/master/src/controls), [physics](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-physics-system), and [loaders](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/tree/master/src/loaders), and [primitives](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/tree/master/src/primitives) within [A-Frame Extras](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/).
- Answered dozens of the community's questions on Stack Overflow and hundreds on Slack.
- Contributed features to A-Frame such as [support for glTF](https://aframe.io/docs/0.5.0/components/gltf-model.html) and [shadows](https://aframe.io/docs/master/components/shadow.html).
- Helped the implementation of the [glTF](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF)
  and [glTF 2 loader on three.js](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/loaders/GLTF2Loader) which benefits the greater WebVR community.
- Provided input on GitHub issues and pull requests which helps drive the direction of the project.

What can we expect? In the short term, things will be similar as Don may have
already felt like a core member. We're just making it official!

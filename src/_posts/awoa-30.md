The big 30! We released A-Frame v0.3.2 to handle some breaking changes in
nightly builds of Firefox and Chromium in regards to the WebVR 1.1.
specification.

Work on the Registry continues with an updated frontend with inclusion of
animation and physics:

![Registry](/images/awoa/registrypage.jpg)

And those will soon be usable from the Inspector:

![Inspector](/images/awoa/inspector-registry-preview.gif)

We're also working on a new command-line tool,
[Angle](https://github.com/ngokevin/angle) to make it easier for developers to
create and consume components from the Registry, and get started building a new
scene.

[And John Carmack uttered the words "A-Frame"](https://youtu.be/zlxyjx3bJ28?t=14m40s).
